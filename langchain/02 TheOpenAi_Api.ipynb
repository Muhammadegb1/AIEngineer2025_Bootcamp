      "A black hole is a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. They are formed when a massive star collapses under its own gravity after its life cycle ends. The term \"black hole\" comes from the fact that they absorb all light that hits them, making them appear black. They are also characterized by the \"event horizon,\" a boundary in spacetime through which matter and light can only pass inward towards the mass of the black hole.None"
